# Security Policy

## Vulnerability Management

This project implements comprehensive security scanning across all components of the application stack.

### Automated Security Scanning

- **Frontend Dependencies**: npm audit scanning for JavaScript/Node.js vulnerabilities
- **Backend Dependencies**: Safety and Bandit scanning for Python security issues
- **Container Images**: Trivy scanning for container vulnerabilities
- These scans are integrated into our CI/CD pipeline and run on every push to `main` and `develop`

### Current Security Status

#### Backend Security Updates

We maintain up-to-date versions of all backend dependencies:

- **Django**: Updated to 4.2.23 (latest LTS with security patches)
- **Django REST Framework**: Updated to 3.15.2 (fixes CVE-2024-21520)
- **Security Tools**: Regular scanning with Safety and Bandit
- **Dependency Management**: Pinned versions for stability and security

#### Frontend Vulnerabilities (Development Dependencies)

The current npm audit reports show vulnerabilities in the following development-only dependencies:

1. **nth-check** (High Severity)
   - Location: `svgo` → `css-select` → `nth-check`
   - Impact: Development build process only
   - Mitigation: Not present in production builds

2. **postcss** (Moderate Severity)  
   - Location: `resolve-url-loader` → `postcss`
   - Impact: Development build process only
   - Mitigation: Not present in production builds

3. **webpack-dev-server** (Moderate Severity)
   - Impact: Development server only
   - Mitigation: Not used in production deployments

#### Why These Vulnerabilities Are Acceptable

1. **Development-Only Impact**: All identified vulnerabilities are in development dependencies that are not included in production builds
2. **Build Process**: The `npm run build` command creates a production bundle that excludes these development dependencies
3. **Production Security**: Production deployments use only the built static files, not the development toolchain
4. **Risk Assessment**: The vulnerabilities affect local development environments, not production users

### Production Security Measures

✅ **Production Dependencies**: All production dependencies pass security audit  
✅ **Container Security**: Docker images are scanned with Trivy before deployment  
✅ **Backend Security**: Python dependencies are scanned with Safety and Bandit  
✅ **Infrastructure Security**: Azure Container Apps provide built-in security features  
✅ **HTTPS Enforcement**: All production traffic uses HTTPS encryption  
✅ **Environment Isolation**: Development vulnerabilities are isolated from production  

### Security Monitoring

Our CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Automated Security Scans**: Every code change triggers security scanning
- **Security Reports**: Detailed vulnerability reports are generated and archived
- **Production Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of production applications
- **Dependency Updates**: Regular monitoring for security updates

### Reporting Security Issues

To report security vulnerabilities:

1. **GitHub Issues**: For non-sensitive security improvements
2. **Private Disclosure**: For critical security vulnerabilities, please contact the development team directly
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Security scans run automatically and generate reports

### Security Best Practices

This project follows security best practices:

- ✅ **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Container Security**: Multi-layer container scanning
- ✅ **Secrets Management**: Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- ✅ **HTTPS Everywhere**: Encrypted communication in production
- ✅ **Minimal Attack Surface**: Production builds exclude development dependencies
- ✅ **Regular Updates**: Continuous monitoring for security updates

### Development vs Production Security

| Environment | Security Scope | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|-------------|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Development** | Full dependency tree | Low | Local environment only |
| **Production** | Runtime dependencies only | Critical | Full security scanning |

The development vulnerabilities identified by npm audit do not affect production security because:

1. Development dependencies are excluded from production builds
2. Production uses compiled/minified static assets
3. Development tools never run in production environments
4. Container deployments use production-optimized images

## Conclusion

While npm audit reports vulnerabilities in development dependencies, our production deployments remain secure through:

- **Build Process Isolation**: Development tools don't reach production
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Multi-layer security validation
- **Production Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring
- **Best Practices**: Following industry security standards

The identified vulnerabilities are acceptable for this application because they exist only in the development toolchain and do not affect production security or end-user safety.
