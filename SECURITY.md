# Security Policy

## Automated Security Scanning

This project implements comprehensive DevSecOps practices with automated security scanning at multiple stages of the CI/CD pipeline.

### Security Scanning Tools

#### 1. Secret Scanning
- **GitLeaks**: Scans for exposed secrets, credentials, and sensitive information in code and git history
- **Frequency**: Every commit and pull request
- **Action**: Pipeline fails if secrets are detected

#### 2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- **Bandit**: Python security linter for identifying common security issues
- **Semgrep**: Multi-language static analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Frequency**: Every build
- **Coverage**: Backend Python code, frontend JavaScript/TypeScript

#### 3. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning
- **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanner
- **NPM Audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability assessment
- **Frequency**: Every build and weekly scheduled scans
- **Action**: Reports generated, high/critical vulnerabilities block deployment

#### 4. Container Security Scanning
- **Trivy**: Container image vulnerability scanner
- **Scans**: Base images, application layers, and installed packages
- **Formats**: SARIF reports for integration with security dashboards
- **Severity Levels**: HIGH and CRITICAL vulnerabilities reported

### Security Gates

#### Pre-deployment Security Checks
1. No secrets detected in code
2. SAST scan passes or approved exceptions exist
3. No critical vulnerabilities in dependencies
4. Container images pass security scan
5. All security tests pass

#### Continuous Monitoring
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated security patch application
- Container base image updates
- Security alert monitoring

### Vulnerability Management

#### Response Process
1. **Critical Vulnerabilities**: Immediate patch deployment
2. **High Vulnerabilities**: Patched within 7 days
3. **Medium/Low Vulnerabilities**: Addressed in next release cycle

#### Documentation
- All security scan results stored as artifacts
- Vulnerability reports available in CI/CD pipeline
- Security exceptions documented and approved

### Compliance & Best Practices

#### Implemented Security Measures
- Principle of least privilege for service accounts
- Encrypted secrets management
- Secure container practices
- Regular security updates
- Infrastructure as Code security scanning

#### Monitoring & Alerting
- Security vulnerability alerts
- Failed security scan notifications
- Anomaly detection for unusual activities
- Compliance reporting

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to:
- Email: security@knotnest.com
- Create a private security advisory on GitHub

**Do not** create public issues for security vulnerabilities.

## Security Updates

Security updates are applied automatically through the CI/CD pipeline:
- Dependencies are updated weekly
- Container base images updated monthly
- Security patches applied immediately upon availability
