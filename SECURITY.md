Security Policy and Vulnerability Management
This document outlines the security scanning practices implemented in the KnotNest CI/CD pipeline and the procedures for reviewing and remediating identified vulnerabilities.

1. Automated Security Scanning Tools
   Our CI/CD pipelines integrate automated security scans to identify potential vulnerabilities in dependencies and code.

Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:

Frontend (React): npm audit is used to identify known vulnerabilities in Node.js packages.

Backend (Django): Bandit is used for static analysis to find common security issues in Python code.

2. Review Process for Security Scan Results
   Security scan results are reviewed regularly to ensure the ongoing security of the KnotNest application.

Pipeline Output Review:

On every successful merge to the main branch (which triggers full deployment), the output of npm audit (frontend) and Bandit (backend) in the GitHub Actions workflow logs must be reviewed.

For Bandit, a bandit_report.json artifact is generated and can be downloaded from the backend CI/CD pipeline run details for a more structured review.

Prioritization:

CRITICAL and HIGH severity vulnerabilities identified by any scan tool must be prioritized for immediate remediation.

Medium and Low severity issues should be tracked and addressed in subsequent development cycles.

3. Remediation Guidelines
   Once vulnerabilities are identified, the following steps should be taken for remediation:

Dependency Updates:

For npm audit findings, attempt to update the vulnerable packages to a version where the vulnerability is resolved. Use npm update or npm install <package>@<version> to specifically target updates.

For Bandit findings, review the flagged code and refactor it to remove the security flaw, following secure coding best practices.

For Python dependencies, update requirements.txt to newer, secure versions of libraries.

Code Fixes:

For direct code vulnerabilities (e.g., from Bandit), implement the necessary code changes to eliminate the vulnerability.

Testing:

After any security fix, ensure that existing automated tests (unit, integration) are run to prevent regressions.

Consider adding new tests specifically for the patched vulnerability if applicable.

4. Reporting and Tracking
   All identified vulnerabilities and their remediation status should be tracked (e.g., in GitHub Issues, if applicable) to ensure they are addressed.

Significant security updates and fixes should be noted in the CHANGELOG.md file under the Fixed section.
